# OneSave 

# Aim

To enable users to setup recurring fractional investments in crypto using Account Abstraction and Token Bound Accounts.

# Rationale

There are very few simple web3 native saving ideas for crypto users. Most of them involve multiple complex steps or need the user to manually transfer their assets from a wallet to an external platform. This manual multi step approach is only suited for niche advanced crypto users. There's a clear need of a simple crypto native investing product for the remaining novice and occasional users.

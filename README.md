# Aim

To enable users to setup recurring fractional investments in crypto using Account Abstraction and Token Bound Accounts.

# Rationale

There are very few simple web3 native saving ideas for crypto users. Most of them involve multiple complex steps or need the user to manually transfer their assets from a wallet to an external platform. This manual multi step approach is only suited for niche advanced crypto users. 

According to [Chainalysis]([url](https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/crypto-exchanges-on-chain-user-segmentation-guide/)) there are 71mn crypto wallets being held by late retail investors with an average holding of $217 each. The report said, "Vast majority of active wallets in a given week are those in late retail, meaning relatively new, low-balance wallets." Even though retail users own more than 90 percent of crypto wallets but they only hold 6.2 percent of digital token assets.
